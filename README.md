## Why Use Session in Cart?

### Security

Session management is crucial in ensuring the security of user data and preventing unauthorized access or tampering. In the context of a restaurant website like Haresturant, here are some reasons why using sessions in the cart is essential for security:

1. **Data Integrity:** Storing cart data in sessions on the server-side makes it much more difficult for users to manipulate their cart contents or prices by altering client-side data. This helps prevent users from exploiting vulnerabilities in the website to get discounts or add items for free.

3. **Data Confidentiality:** Sessions provide a secure way to store sensitive information such as the user's cart contents. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the client-side and can be manipulated, sessions are stored on the server and are not accessible to the user.

In conclusion, using sessions in the cart of Haresturant provides a higher level of security and simplifies the development and maintenance of the website. It ensures that users have a secure and glitch-free experience while interacting with the restaurant's online ordering system.
